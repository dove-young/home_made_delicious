Introduction
===================

From a dough to a delicious traditional loaf means a lot of work to do. Especially when you want a cracking surface, a beautiful cheese like structure, and a strong flavour. Long time fermentation lead to a strong flavour while extra fermmentation lead to extra acid. So a good balance is quite necessary. 

Also a long time fermmentation means deep relationship with environment, I mean weathers, seasons which leads to different temporatures. I have to make different reactions, in advance.

Especially, since I used to use natural yeast to ferment my dough, I would need to take care my yeast everyday. Try to keep it in the most active status on the D day while keep them in the rest, even in a sleep in other days.

I used to use a weekly plan to make sure I can get my loaf done in the weekend. As time went on, I find it is not enough.  Long time data collection is quite necessary for me to deal with accidental issues ( Yes, it really comes. We've been in cold spring for 2 weeks). That is why I made this database schema for my loaf.

There is another benefit from the database. 

As Fred Brooks, in Chapter 9 of The Mythical Man-Month, said 

> Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. 
> Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious. 

I may not need to write recipes for each loaf separately. You get these tables, the recipes will be obvious. :-)

Database Schma
===================

This database schema is still very rough. I will refine in as soon as possible.
